Barrier Option Pricing Using Monte Carlo Simulation
This Python script simulates the pricing of an up-and-out barrier call option using the Monte Carlo method. The simulation is based on stochastic modeling of stock prices over time, with random price movements generated using a normal distribution. If the stock price exceeds a predefined barrier level, the option becomes worthless.

Key Concepts
Up-and-out barrier option: A type of exotic option where the option is "knocked out" (becomes worthless) if the underlying stock price rises above a specified barrier level before expiration.
Monte Carlo simulation: A computational algorithm that uses repeated random sampling to estimate the payoff of an option by simulating stock price paths.
